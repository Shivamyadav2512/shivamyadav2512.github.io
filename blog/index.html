    <h2>How does it feel to drop phone for a week: Unplugged</h2>

    <p>So i stopped using phone for a week. No calls. No messages. Nothing. </p>

    <p>After randomly scrolling through the play store i stumbledupon an app called "Offtime" which let you avoid using your phone for a specific time. I used to think that i spend less time on phone but app's analytics shows something else. I had 100+ session on my phone daily and most used apps were WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. My device usage was 5 hours a day.</p>

    <p> So i ended up doing self reflection and decided to stop using phone for a week. I switched off my phone and used my email address for the communication. It was great experience as i felt more calm and was getting more time to actually do things with less or no interruptions.</p>

    <p> <strong>What i learned?</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Sometimes its okay not to be connected with the world or getting overwhelmed with all the information.</li>
  <li>You get more time for yourself</li>
  <li>Less or no interruptions</li>
  <li>You feel out of the loop</li>
</ul>    </p>

    <p><strong>Result :</strong><br>
      My phone usage is significantly less now. I don't check my phone's notification for more than 3 times in a day.</p>
